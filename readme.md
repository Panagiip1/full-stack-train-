# MEAN stack app

to start node app.js

or nodemon app.js for updated automatically
and ignore the public folder we use nodemon.json to define this.
Moreover we add to the nodemon.json verbose to print out to the terminal which actions is doing when we start the nodemon!

to start the controller from the editor and fetch the data of the collection(db) from the editor we must use nmp install mongo version 2... it doesnt work with mongo 3 it needs alterations in the code of controller(hotels.controllers.js)!
